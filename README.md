My mission is to create easy-to-understand, straight-forward, and quick Linux related tutorials, guides, and how to videos.

Most of my videos are for Linux system administrators (beginners to advanced) or anyone needing to deploy or setup something on Linux systems.

Sometimes there will also be Windows videos.

If you are a beginner and want to learn about Linux, my channel will definitely help you.

I hope you learn something from my videos!
